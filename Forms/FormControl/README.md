# Form Control
I'm pushing through the last few section of the W3schools curriculum for HTML. I already
completed the free Codecademy material on HTML and found the material on Forms to be lacking.
Now that I am going through W3schools' material, I'm finding the same shortcomings.
- there are tons of them and they all have a bunch of similar attributes and they all generally look similar, so it's all hard to retain
- they aren't very useful as they generally initiate database behavior which is beyond 
just about everyone who is learning HTML
- when I started to learn javascript, they don't really show me how to use these cool ways to input data offered by forms, for my javascript practice programs  

**So this is a project dedicated to studying HTML forms by making javascript functions that
grab the information from the form and output something back to the page.**  

It's going to take a lot longer to finish up these W3schools HTML sections, but I will feel much better about the material.
